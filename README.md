## Troubleshooting

**Q: My data disappeared!**  
A: Data is stored in your browser's localStorage. If you cleared your browser data or used incognito/private mode, the data will be lost. Always export to CSV for backup.

**Q: Can I use this on multiple devices?**  
A: Each device stores data independently. Use the CSV export/import feature to transfer data between devices.

**Q: The page won't load properly**  
A: Make sure you have an internet connection for the initial load (to download React and icons). After that, it works offline.

**Q: Can I customize the appearance?**  
A: Yes! The CSS is included in the HTML file. You can modify the styles to match your preferences.

**Q: How do I move items between boxes?**  
A: Click and drag items to move them between boxes and sub-groups. The cursor will change to a grab icon when hovering over draggable items.

**Q: How do I select multiple items?**  
A: Click "Bulk Mode" to enable bulk selection, then check the boxes next to items you want to select.

## Tips for Moving

1. **Start early** - Begin cataloging items weeks before your move
2. **Be specific** - Instead of "clothes", use "winter clothes", "work shirts", etc.
3. **Use quantities** - Knowing you have 15 books vs "some books" helps with planning
4. **Export regularly** - Create CSV backups as you add items
5. **Use search** - Quickly find items when you have many boxes
6. **Organize with sub-groups** - Keep related items together
7. **Use bulk operations** - Select multiple items for quick management
8. **Take photos** - While organizing digitally, photos of packed boxes can be helpful too
